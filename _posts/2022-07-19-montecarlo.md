## Monte Carlo Simulation

Monte Carlo Simulation is common method in financial analysis. It is based on probabilistic technique to estimate the outcome in uncertain condition. More reference as below:

## Define Problem

ABC Company has a new-product development decision which involves a lot of uncertainty. The company is interested in evaluating the risk associated with the project and need to answer 3 questions as follows:

1. What is the risk that the net present value (NPV) over the five years will not be positive?
2. What are the chances that the product will show a positive cumulative net profit in the third year?
3. In the fifth year, what minimum amount of cumulative profit are we likely to achieve with a probability of at least 90%?

Suppose that the Company has identified the following uncertain variables in the model and the distributions and parameters that describe them, as follows:

a. Market size: normal with mean of 2,000,000 units and standard deviation of 400,000 units. 
b. R&D costs: uniform between $600,000,000 and $800,000,000. 
c. Clinical trial costs: normal with mean of $150,000,000 and standard deviation $30,000,000. 
d. Annual market growth factor: triangular with minimum = 2%, maximum 6%, and most likely = 3%. 
e. Annual market share growth rate: triangular with minimum = 15%, maximum = 25%, and most likely = 20%. 


## Code

I run the folowing code in Python.

        npv_profit = 0
        year = 0
        while year < project_year:
            profit = round((share * mksize *  unit_margin * 12)/1000000)
            cumulated_profit = cumulated_profit + profit
            yearly_cum_profit.append(cumulated_profit)
            npv_profit = npv_profit + round(profit/(1+discount_rate)**(year+1))
            share = share * (1+share_growth[year])
            mksize = mksize * (1+ annual_mk_growth[year])
            year += 1

    return outputs

## Result

With the `jekyll-gist` plugin, which is preinstalled on Github Pages, you can embed gists simply by using the `gist` command:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/5555251.js?file=gist.md"></script>

## Images

Upload an image to the *assets* folder and embed it with `![title](/assets/name.jpg))`. Keep in mind that the path needs to be adjusted if Jekyll is run inside a subfolder.

A wrapper `div` with the class `large` can be used to increase the width of an image or iframe.

## Embedded content

You can also embed a lot of stuff, for example from YouTube, using the `embed.html` include.

{% include embed.html url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_C0A5zX-iqM" %}
