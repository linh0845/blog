## Background  

This article is about my Tabeau experience. Tableau is an interactive data visualization tool focused on business intelligence. I neither have practical experience with Tableau nor have used the tool in my works before. I had a chance to know it when I studied the Data Visualization course in my Business Analytics (BA) diploma last Winter 2022 semester. In that course, I learned some fundamental principles in data visualization and how to use Tableau for data storytelling. I had some projects done in Tableau and will show one of those in this article.  

## What I did  

- Get a dataset. I got a free Airbnb dataset from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com).  
- Use Tableau to tell a story about that dataset.   

I had a personal plan to move to Toronto in May 2022. So I really wanted to know the Airbnb market in the city, what price ranges are and which neighborhoods are better for my stay. This personal curiosity motivated me to explore the dataset and get the insights I needed. Tableau was a new tool for me and it took me a lot of time to familiarize its uses. Somehow Tableau is quite similar to Power BI, which is also a BI tool.  

## What I learned from the project  

The project was a chance for me to have a practical experience with Tableau. I know one more tool for data storytelling. If I had to choose between Power BI and Tableau, I would prefer Power BI, which I think is more user-friendly, just my personal thought.

## Result  

The dashboard is in [this link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/linh.tran3604/viz/AirbnbListinginToronto/storytoshare). So far, it was not an excellent work, but it's my first one in Tableau. I can make it better if I spend more time. But I won't. Maybe I will practice Tableau with other datasets.
