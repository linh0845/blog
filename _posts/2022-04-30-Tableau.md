## Background  

To be honest, I neither have practical experience with Tableau nor have used the tool in my works before. I had a chance to know it when I studied the Data Visualization course in my Business Analytics (BA) diploma last Winter 2022 semester. In that course, I learned some fundamental principles in data visualization and how to use Tableau for data storytelling. I had some projects done in Tableau and will show one of the samples in this article.  

## What I did  

- Get a dataset. I got a free Airbnb dataset from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com).  
- Use Tableau to tell a story about that dataset. I had a personal plan to move to Toronto in May 2022. Therefore, I wanted to know the Airbnb market in the city, what price ranges are and which neighborhoods are better for my stay. This personal curiosity motivated me to explore the dataset and get the insights I needed. Tableau is a new tool for me and it took me a lot of time to familiarize its uses. Somehow I worked with Power BI before, so they are quite similar.  

## What I learned from the project  

The project was a chance for me to have a practical experience with Tableau. I know one more tool for data storytelling. If I had to choose between Power BI and Tableau, I would prefer Power BI, which I think is more user-friendly, just my personal thought.

## Result  

The dashboard is [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/linh.tran3604/viz/AirbnbListinginToronto/storytoshare). So far, it was not excellent, but it's my first one in Tableau. I can make it better if I spend more time. But I won't do it again. Maybe I will practice Tableau with other datasets.
