## What is PVM?  

PVM is an approach to explain variance in revenue or margins caused by 3 main components: price, volume and mix.  
- Price impact: variation due to change in higher or lower in price.  
- Volume impact: variation due to total sales units.  
- Mix impact: measures the impact resulting from a change in the proportion of a specific item to total portfolio.  

The method is used in variance analysis (actual vs budget, this year vs last year) to help understand the factors that contribute to variances. Input required comprise price, quantity/volume by products/categories. The spreadsheet and chart below give a simple way to explain it.

## Why I learn it

I remember when I was at MSD, my boss told me to prepare an analysis for the forecasted sales. She wanted a PVM analysis. I had no idea what it is. There are so many FP&A things I need to learn. PVM is just an example of those knowledge I need to upgrade. And yet here is my note for what I need to remember about PVM.
