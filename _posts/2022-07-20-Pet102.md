## Acknowledgement

This project was for our kitten. Mon, we miss you so much!

## Background

This was part of my submission in "Strategic Financial Project" module of the Master program 2021. The requirement was to make a 5-year strategic plan for a new business venture. I was inspired by my kitten to run a new pet care business in Vietnam. So I decided to make a plan for that idea and write a consultancy report. The report included 8 main sections with max word count of 4500, as follow the requirement and instruction from the Module Leader.

## 1. Introduction

Pet care has been known as one of the most lucrative businesses and attracts many investors to the merit of a rewarding and stable industry. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, sales forecast for the global pet market is increasing, and the Vietnam market follows a similar trend. With a rising number of pets and pet owners, demand for pet products, pet cares, and other pet segments is set to increase. The idea of opening pet stores in Vietnam sounds promising despite intense competition in the retail landscape. Pet102, a new business venture, is about to join the marketplace, focusing on pet products and services retail. This strategic report is an outline of Pet102’s proposal.

## 2. Strategic analysis

#### 2.1. Company ownership  
The company’s shareholders are three private investors with equal stakes financed from their funds. Investors are enthusiastic about pets and believe in the growth of the pet culture in Vietnam. Two out of the three join the management team. They have work experience in retail and management consulting, bringing them a solid managerial and business background.  

#### 2.2. Products and services segmentation  
The company provides a wide range of products and services to offer pet owners all their needs for taking the best care of their pet friends. The segmentation includes four main categories as follows:
- Food, feeding, and treats
- Supplies and accessories
- Health and wellness
- Services: grooming, daycare, consultation

#### 2.3. Market analysis  
Vietnam's pet industry is among the most robust growth markets. It was the fourth in the top 10 fastest-growing countries with a market value 2012-2017 CAGR of 12.2% (GlobalPETS, 2017). According to an April 2021 report by Euromonitor International, sales value growth of pet care in Vietnam is 16.1% for 2016-2021 CAGR, and the forecast is 15% for 2021-2026 CAGR (Euromonitor International, 2021b). Compared to other countries, the Vietnam market has a high growth rate due to convincing reasons.  
- Pet ownership has become trendy among young people in Vietnam. Millennials and Gen Z are changing Vietnamese’s attitude toward pets, making pets be companions and part of the family (Mai, 2020). These are critical attributes for the increasing number of pet ownership and pet adoption rate in Vietnam.  
- Vietnamese consumer income and expenditure are set to soar. Millennials and Gen Z drive the wealthy consumer base (Euromonitor International, 2021f). Consequently, they will increase the budget for pets, resulting in rising demand for pet products and services.

Seeing a solid growth of the pet care market in Vietnam, Pet102 enters the pet retail landscape and expects to capture the increasing demand for pet foods and pet services. The company should take a disciplined strategic analysis to precisely evaluate its opportunity. The strategic analysis should include external and internal factors to develop an in-depth understanding of the market beforehand.

#### 2.4. External environment analysis  
2.4.1. Macro-environment with PEST  
- Political
Vietnam has a stable political system that benefits businesses in economic and social infrastructures, policies, and regulations (McKinsey, 2019). As a company created under Vietnamese law, Pet102 has a secure environment for competition with minor tax and interest rates changes. The company can take this advantage for its planning and forecast with firmness and accuracy.
One area to consider is a lack of specific regulations for pets and animals. In advanced economies like US or Euro, animal rights are strictly put forward. Nevertheless, it is not well established in Vietnam. Legislators and the government have limited supports regarding animal welfare.  
- Economic
Vietnam macroeconomic indicators show enormous potential. The economic transformation stimulated by the government since 1986 was fruitful in helping level up the nation from one of the world’s poorest countries to a middle-income economy. GPD per capita increased 2.7 times to almost USD 2,800 over 2002-2020 (World Bank, 2021). Moreover, Vietnam outperforms many major Southeast Asian economies, ranking the second-highest for forecast GDP growth, with 6.5% CAGR per annum, and the fastest middle-class growth, with a forecast at 9.2% CAGR up to 2023 (McKinsey, 2019). With political stability, its economic push and growing middleclass make the country more attractive to investors and a strong contender for business investment opportunities.  
Another critical attribute is per capita gross income, which is forecast to proliferate by 154% over 2021-2040 (Euromonitor International, 2021f). This factor might positively impact the retail sector, increasing the expenditure and budget for pet products and services.  
- Socio-cultural
Beliefs and attitudes toward pets are changing significantly (Mai, 2020). In the past, Vietnamese people treated cats and dogs as simply functional animals for house protection or pest control. The increasing trend of pet humanitarian has driven the way animals are being treated. People desire to own pets as companions and treat them as family members. The change is a solid driver to boost the pet industry growth.  
The young economic forces speed up digital momentum. Targeted customer groups of Pet102 are set to be Gen Z and Millennials, who are the digital native generation with many tech-savvy consumers. They also show a more frequent online shopping habit, creating potential chances for online retailers (Euromonitor International, 2021f). Also, young customers like to share their pet friends on social media and interact with pet communities online. These factors offer a clear advantage to accelerate digital marketing and facilitate new customers acquisition via online channels.
- Technological
The emerging of e-commerce is one of the key factors that Pet102 should consider for its distribution channel. In 2020, the government announced a master plan to support the development of e-commerce in Vietnam. The e-commerce market scale is expected to enlarge by 2025, with 55% of the population engaging in online shopping, reaching a market value of USD 35 billion under the B2C model (Vietnam News, 2020). The future of pet retail cannot exclude e-commerce channels. It is crucial to consider online sales in Pet102’s business strategy and planning.  
Digital transformation is helping businesses gain more competitive advantages. Notably, the retail sector is experiencing a dramatic shift driven by advanced technologies. Many companies in Vietnam are taking advantage of e-commerce platforms, digital marketing activities, data- driven technologies to increase productivity, reduce operation costs, and offer customers a more personalized and advanced experience. When joining the retail landscape, Pet102 should acknowledge the vital role of technology in contributing to the success of its business.
