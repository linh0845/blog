## Acknowledgement

This project was for our kitten. Mon, we miss you so much!

## Background

This was part of my submission in "Strategic Financial Project" module of the Master program 2021. The requirement was to make a 5-year strategic plan for a new business venture. I was inspired by my kitten to run a new pet care business in Vietnam. So I decided to make a plan for that business idea and write a consultancy report. The report included 8 main sections, as follow the requirement and instruction from the Module Leader.
1. Introduction
2. Strategic analysis

5. Strategic choices

## 1. Introduction

Pet care has been known as one of the most lucrative businesses and attracts many investors to the merit of a rewarding and stable industry. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, sales forecast for the global pet market is increasing, and the Vietnam market follows a similar trend. With a rising number of pets and pet owners, demand for pet products, pet cares, and other pet segments is set to increase. The idea of opening pet stores in Vietnam sounds promising despite intense competition in the retail landscape. Pet102, a new business venture, is about to join the marketplace, focusing on pet products and services retail. This strategic report is an outline of Pet102’s proposal.

## 2. Strategic analysis

#### 2.1. Company ownership  
The company’s shareholders are three private investors with equal stakes financed from their funds. Investors are enthusiastic about pets and believe in the growth of the pet culture in Vietnam. Two out of the three join the management team. They have work experience in retail and management consulting, bringing them a solid managerial and business background.  

#### 2.2. Products and services segmentation  
The company provides a wide range of products and services to offer pet owners all their needs for taking the best care of their pet friends. The segmentation includes four main categories as follows:
- Food, feeding, and treats
- Supplies and accessories
- Health and wellness
- Services: grooming, daycare, consultation

#### 2.3. Market analysis  
Vietnam's pet industry is among the most robust growth markets. It was the fourth in the top 10 fastest-growing countries with a market value 2012-2017 CAGR of 12.2% (GlobalPETS, 2017). According to an April 2021 report by Euromonitor International, sales value growth of pet care in Vietnam is 16.1% for 2016-2021 CAGR, and the forecast is 15% for 2021-2026 CAGR (Euromonitor International, 2021b). Compared to other countries, the Vietnam market has a high growth rate due to convincing reasons.  
- Pet ownership has become trendy among young people in Vietnam. Millennials and Gen Z are changing Vietnamese’s attitude toward pets, making pets be companions and part of the family (Mai, 2020). These are critical attributes for the increasing number of pet ownership and pet adoption rate in Vietnam.  
- Vietnamese consumer income and expenditure are set to soar. Millennials and Gen Z drive the wealthy consumer base (Euromonitor International, 2021f). Consequently, they will increase the budget for pets, resulting in rising demand for pet products and services.

Seeing a solid growth of the pet care market in Vietnam, Pet102 enters the pet retail landscape and expects to capture the increasing demand for pet foods and pet services. The company should take a disciplined strategic analysis to precisely evaluate its opportunity. The strategic analysis should include external and internal factors to develop an in-depth understanding of the market beforehand.

2.4.2. Pet Industry with Porter’s Five Forces  
#### 2.5. Internal analysis with SWOT
